# Capstone-Project
Our final year graduation project: Design &amp; Implementation of A Floating PV Power Plant For Madinah Region.

This project proposes the implementation of a floating photovoltaic (PV) power plant on Al-Aqoul Lake in the Madinah Region, to generate clean, sustainable electricity while minimizing water evaporation. Through electrical study and design, prototype construction, and financial analysis, the project seeks to develop renewable energy sources, enhance energy efficiency, and foster economic development. This initiative has the potential to become one of Saudi Arabia's leading sources of affordable, clean electricity, aligning with the nation's efforts to diminish environmental pollution and its commitment to clean, sustainable energy, as outlined in Vision 2030. By leveraging advanced engineering techniques and academic knowledge, the project represents a significant step towards a greener future.
